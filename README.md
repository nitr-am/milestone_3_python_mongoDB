# My online reading History

This is my online books reading history. Here I can add all the books I am reading, and that I am going to read. I can add some details about the books, like the genre, date of puclication, how much did I liked it and some comments about it.
This will be very usefull because many times we forget the books we read, and as they are precious for me I want to have them somewhere and being able to consult them anytime.
This is good also because I can keep count of the books I read. 

## UX

This project is intended to people who have interest for the world of books and are interested on keep a record of the books they read and their perception of the the book in matter at the moment. 
I opted for a single page document to visualize the books in a list because I am only intersted on watching the book title and its author at a first glance, and then my review about it. I think the users will need the same if they want to keep a record of the books they read. 
In the main page the users will see the books as a list in a simple way because is the only thing that matters. The simpler the better. 
There is a navigation bar at the top in which we can find all the functionality of the appliation. Add a new book, update an existant one, look the different generes, modify them, and add some new ones. 

As a User I would want:

- To easily view all the books in a list. 
- To see the most relevant information of the book as a first glance. 
- To easily add a new book I recenly read. 
- To easily modify any book.
- To easily have access to the review I make of a book. 
- To easily delete any book. 

I took the structure of my project from a project done prior to this one in the Code Institute topic related on how How Python Talks to Data from the "*Interactive Frontend Development*" unit. It was a very good inspiration for me because it had all what I wanted for my project. 
The use of python language in a combination with databases usage coming from MongoDB. 
It was a challenge for me, but at the end it was highly rewarding as well because I feel I complitely understood wverything I did and for me that is the most imporant thing.
